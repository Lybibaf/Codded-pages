                At the very begining were the fresh moment of LYBIBAF. When the environment and its plants were still very young making it's beauty much more appreciable. As time passed on, Our environment and it's plants grew older nevertheless becoming more and more
                beautiful. Also, as time passed on, the college's students and teachers population increased and as such building extensions were made to hold the entire students capacity. And till date Our population keeps increasing and increasing.
